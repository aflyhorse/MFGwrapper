# MFGwrapper

This is a wrapper for KanColle Public View Tool [**_MyFleetGirls_**](https://github.com/ponkotuy/MyFleetGirls).
This tool is intended to provide a user-friendly UI for Windows users. It also rendered the [PAC file](https://myfleet.moe/assets/proxy.pac) unnecessary, thus frees your IE.

_MyFleetGirls_ only supports HTTP(s) proxy protocol. Please make sure you are using a compatible one.

This project is developed with Visual Studio 2015.

If you meet some problem or have any advice, just feel free to open a new issue.
